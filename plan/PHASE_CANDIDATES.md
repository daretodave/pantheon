# PHASE_CANDIDATES

> `/expand` reads accumulated signals (audit findings, critique
> findings, GH issues, spec drift, design landings, data
> growth) and proposes new phase candidates here. `/oversight`
> reviews and promotes them to `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md`.
>
> Posture: **bold** (per `plan/bearings.md`). `/expand` runs
> at standard cadence and files candidates here. `/oversight`
> is the only path to promote.

## Considered (awaiting promotion)

<!-- Format:
### <NN>. <Phase title>
**Score:** N.N (impact: N, ease: N)
**Source pass:** <expand pass number>
**Filed:** <ISO date>
**Why:** <one-paragraph rationale>
**Scope sketch:** <2-3 lines of what would ship>
-->

### 03. Newsletter subscribe (Buttondown embed)

**Score:** 3.0 (impact: 4, ease: 5, +1 multi, -1 vendor)
**Source pass:** 1
**Filed:** 2026-05-14
**Source signals:**
- `spec.md:281` — same spec phase 18 row that names RSS also
  names "newsletter."
- Seed S4 — same seed names Buttondown form embed.

**Why:** Split from candidate 01 because newsletter introduces
a vendor dependency (Buttondown account + DNS records once a
domain swap lands) that RSS doesn't share. Lower priority than
RSS because RSS already serves the "return-reader" need; the
newsletter is incremental on top. File so it isn't lost — but
defer until S1 (domain swap) lands, since `noreply@tiered.app`
or similar makes the sign-up trust signal real.

**Scope sketch:**
- `/newsletter` minimal page: Buttondown embed form, brief
  promise copy, no SDK.
- Footer link surfaces it once.
- No auth integration; subscribers list lives in Buttondown.
- e2e: page renders + form has the expected `<form action>`
  pointing at buttondown.

**Estimated phases:** 1.
**Conflicts:** depends on S1 (custom domain) for a credible
sender identity; can ship before but trust signal will be weak.

### 04. `/u/[handle]` real public profile (drain the phase-10 shell)

**Score:** 5.5 (impact: 6, ease: 5, +2 multi, +1 cheap-and-bounded)
**Source pass:** 2
**Filed:** 2026-05-17
**Source signals:**
- `spec.md:73` — the locked URL contract lists
  `/u/[handle]` as "public user profile". It is still the
  phase-10 *shell*: `src/app/(default)/u/[handle]/page.tsx`
  renders only the signed-in viewer's own handle, 404s every
  other handle, surfaces zero activity, and is `noIndex:true`.
- The page's own in-code TODO (line 38-40) blocks itself on
  "phase 12 lights up real users table writes" — phases 11
  (`users`+`votes`), 12 (`comments`), 35 (vote read path), and
  36 (comment read path) have all shipped. The stated unblock
  condition is satisfied; nothing consumes it.
- Build-plan exhaustion: every phase row in
  `01_build_plan.md` is `[x]`. No remaining phase owns turning
  the contracted profile surface real — so it will stay a
  shell forever unless a phase is proposed.

**Why:** This is textbook spec drift — a contracted URL family
that has been a stub since phase 10 while the entire data
substrate it needs (users, votes, comments + their read paths)
was built underneath it by later phases. Now that the plan is
exhausted, no automatic mechanism will ever pick this up; the
loop will iterate-polish pages that exist and never build the
one the spec promised. Scope is genuinely bounded: read the
user's public votes/comments for a handle, render a
spoiler-safe activity surface, drop `noIndex`, resolve real
handles instead of 404. Spoiler discipline (P0) applies — the
profile must never echo a held/hidden comment or leak an
unpublished season position.

**Scope sketch:**
- Resolve `handle` → `users` row (handle/nickname/sub); 404
  only on genuinely-unknown handles, not "not me".
- Read that user's *published* comments + their public vote
  participation counts (never pending/hidden; never raw ballot
  detail that could spoil).
- Activity surface: counts + recent published-comment
  excerpts + shows/seasons they've engaged, all spoiler-safe.
- Drop `noIndex` for populated profiles; keep `noIndex` for
  empty ones.
- e2e: new `apps/e2e/tests/user-profile.spec.ts` — known
  handle renders activity, unknown 404s, mobile reflow at
  375px; row added to `canonical-urls.ts` + `page-reads.ts`.

**Estimated phases:** 1.
**Conflicts:** none. Fulfils `spec.md:73`; no contract change.
Spoiler-safety is a build constraint, not a conflict.

### 05. Critique-harness repair (anon clean-profile + authed cookie-injection)

**Score:** 3.0 (impact: 7, ease: 3, +1 multi, -3 needs-user-call)
**Source pass:** 2
**Filed:** 2026-05-17
**Source signals:**
- `plan/CRITIQUE.md:37` — needs-user-call: the anon critique
  pass cannot run clean; the Chrome profile carries a
  persistent tiered.tv login so the "anonymous" walk runs
  authenticated.
- `plan/CRITIQUE.md:38` — needs-user-call: the authed critique
  pass cannot run at all; no cookie-injection primitive in the
  environment (httpOnly `__session`, no set-cookie browser
  tool, `WebFetch` has no header param).
- `/critique` pass count is still **0** — the external-observer
  loop has never produced a scored pass since it was wired
  (phase 19). Both passes are infra-blocked on the same root.

**Why:** Two independent needs-user-call rows converge on one
root cause: the critique harness has no clean-anon profile and
no authed cookie-injection path, so the entire external-observer
feedback channel is dark. `/march` Step 2 will keep skipping
critique forever because its precondition (a runnable harness)
is unmet. This is the kind of systemic gap `/expand` exists to
name. Filed so it is not lost; flagged `[needs-user-call]`
because the fix needs an environment decision (an incognito /
clean-profile harness for anon, plus a set-cookie primitive or
pre-seeded profile for authed) that only the user/oversight can
authorize — and the cloud runner has no Chrome MCP at all, so
this can only ever land via a local pass.

**Scope sketch:**
- Anon: a clean/incognito Chrome profile (or a documented
  profile-reset step) so the anonymous walk is genuinely
  logged-out.
- Authed: pre-seed the freshly-minted `CRITIQUE_SESSION_COOKIE`
  into the harness profile before the authed pass, or adopt a
  browser tool with a set-cookie primitive.
- Update `skills/critique.md` + the reader sub-agent doc with
  the working harness contract; reset CRITIQUE pass metadata so
  the first real scored pass counts.

**Estimated phases:** 1.
**Conflicts:** `[needs-user-call]` — requires a user/oversight
environment decision; not autonomously shippable, and never
shippable from the cloud loop (no Chrome MCP on the runner).

## Considered (below threshold)

### B1. `content/calendar.yml` + post-finale event triggers

**Score:** 2.0 (impact: 5, ease: 4, -2 expensive/uncertain)
**Source signals:** `spec.md:294` promises "Event triggers (a
finale air date in `content/calendar.yml`) prompt `/iterate` to
write a 'post-finale ranking shift' piece spoiler-free."
Calendar doesn't exist; no `/iterate` hook.
**Why deferred:** The auto-write piece is still hand-wavy
(what does "write a post-finale ranking shift piece" mean in
skill terms?). **Pass-2 re-eval:** the build plan is now fully
exhausted, and the event-trigger half of spec.md's "How
self-sustaining works here" (spec.md:289-296) is the single
remaining unbuilt self-sustaining mechanism — a second signal.
Still below threshold because the scope is undefined in skill
terms, not because the signal is thin. Worth raising to a
Pending candidate once a real finale produces a hand-authored
"shift" post the loop can pattern from, or once `/oversight`
defines what the auto-write contract should be.

### 01. RSS feeds (`/feed.xml` + `/feed/<show>.xml`)

**Score:** 5.5 (impact: 5, ease: 5, +2 multi, +1 cheap)
**Source pass:** 1
**Filed:** 2026-05-14
**Source signals:**
- `spec.md:281` — spec lists "RSS + newsletter" as phase 18, but
  the build plan's phase 18 became "Performance + a11y polish"
  (spec phase 17). RSS never landed; spec/plan drift.
- Seed S4 — user-emptied seed for "Newsletter + RSS" with
  trigger "when content velocity exceeds ~15 published canons +
  5 themes." Current state: 13 shows, 12 themes, 8+ canons —
  trigger is reached.
- bearings Rules 1 + 3 quotas both cleared (phases 22 + 24
  shipped 13 shows + 12 themes); regular readers now have
  enough to subscribe to.

**Why:** RSS is the lowest-friction return-reader channel and
the only spec-promised feature still missing from the build
plan. It's also a SEO signal — feed-discovery surfaces on
aggregators that don't index regular HTML. The catalog is large
enough that "new canon, new list, new season blurb" updates
benefit from a stream. Scope is genuinely small (handwritten
XML route; no SDK; no auth) and orthogonal to other surfaces.

**Scope sketch:**
- `app/feed.xml/route.ts` — global RSS 2.0: latest items across
  shows / themed lists / canon revisions, sorted by file mtime
  or a `published` frontmatter field.
- `app/feed/[show]/route.ts` — per-show feed: that show's
  seasons + canon updates only.
- Add feed discovery `<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">`
  to relevant page heads.
- Sitemap entries for both feed routes.
- e2e: fetch `/feed.xml`, assert content-type + RSS 2.0 root +
  `<channel><item>` shape + `<link>` matches canonical URL.

**Estimated phases:** 1.
**Conflicts:** none. Spec-aligned; design has no opinion on
feeds (no UI impact beyond the discovery `<link>`).
**Promoted in:** oversight 2026-05-14 (queued behind phase 26 per user direction)
**Build-plan row:** Phase 32 — RSS feeds (`01_build_plan.md`)

### 02. Inline search takeover (replace `/search` route page)

**Score:** 4.0 (impact: 6, ease: 5, +1 multi, -1 scope risk)
**Source pass:** 1
**Filed:** 2026-05-14
**Status:** shipped before promotion — phase 29 (commit c4ed547,
"feat: inline search overlay; retire /search — phase 29") landed
the cmd+K overlay with filter chips + keyboard nav, retired the
`/search` route as a 308, and reuses the phase 15 local index
exactly as the candidate sketched. Recording here for audit
trail; no new build-plan row needed.

**Source signals:**
- Seed S7 — user direction 2026-05-13 ("Search needs to be
  inline (or takeover) — not a new page"). Detailed scope
  sketch already filed.
- Design landing — phase 19b shipped the new chrome with a
  `⌕ Search` icon in the header; the icon currently links to
  the standalone `/search` route, which contradicts the user's
  brief.
- bearings "Content velocity & editorial cadence" — content
  catalog now warrants frictionless cross-show search; route
  navigation breaks the browsing flow.

**Scope sketch (as filed; matches what shipped):**
- New `<SearchTakeover>` in `src/components/chrome/`: panel
  slides down under `<TopNav>`, ARIA combobox, `<input
  type="search">` + grouped results.
- Header `⌕ Search` becomes a button toggling the takeover (no
  navigation).
- Per-keystroke local search; `<mark>` highlights in result
  titles + first blurb line.
- Keyboard: ↑/↓ navigate, Enter activate, Esc close; click
  outside closes.
- `/search?q=…` deep-link opens takeover pre-populated;
  `app/search/page.tsx` becomes the no-JS fallback.
- e2e: open via icon, type → results, keyboard nav, deep-link.

**Promoted in:** oversight 2026-05-14 (retroactive — phase 29 already shipped the scope)
**Build-plan row:** Phase 29 — Inline search overlay; retire `/search` (`01_build_plan.md` line 101)

### S7. Inline / takeover search (seed) — superseded by candidate #02

**Status:** shipped via phase 29 (commit c4ed547). Seed and
candidate #02 describe the same scope; both moved here together
so the audit trail is complete. The seed's accessibility
contract (ARIA combobox, `aria-live="polite"`, Esc/click-out
close, ↑/↓ navigation) matches what phase 29 e2e covers.

**Promoted in:** oversight 2026-05-14 (retroactive)
**Build-plan row:** Phase 29 — Inline search overlay; retire `/search` (`01_build_plan.md` line 101)

## Seed candidates (pre-loaded for /expand to evaluate)

These aren't promoted; they're seeds the user pre-emptied so
`/expand` doesn't have to discover them. `/expand` may score,
score-and-defer, or merge with newly-discovered candidates.

### S1. Custom domain swap (`tiered.app` → primary)

**Trigger:** when `tiered.app` is purchased + DNS configured.
**Scope sketch:** add domain in Vercel, update Auth0 Allowed
URLs, swap `AUTH0_BASE_URL`, swap `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` to
`noreply@tiered.app`, run `setup/05_email.md` v2 swap,
update all hardcoded `tiered.tv` refs in
content + canonicalUrl helpers.

### S2. Resend email provider migration

**Trigger:** depends on S1 (needs domain DNS).
**Scope sketch:** runbook in `setup/05_email.md` v2 path —
account, domain verify, API key, Auth0 SMTP wiring, bounce
webhook, swap from Auth0 dev SMTP. Bumps `setup/00_files.md`
05 status to ✅.

### S3. Cron-enable cloud /march

**Trigger:** after user vets the manual cloud workflow_dispatch
runs cleanly for ~1 week.
**Scope sketch:** add `schedule: - cron: '0 * * * *'` (or
similar cadence) to `.github/workflows/march.yml`. Bound by
the daily commit ceiling check and concurrency group already
in place.

### S4. Newsletter + RSS

**Trigger:** when content velocity exceeds ~15 published
canons + 5 themes (organic discovery via search starts to
matter).
**Scope sketch:** Buttondown form embed at `/newsletter` (no
SDK required); handwritten RSS 2.0 with global feed at
`/feed.xml` and per-show feeds at `/feed/<show>.xml`; sitemap
entries; e2e validates RSS 2.0 shape.

### S5. SVG → PNG OG generator — OBSOLETE (do not promote)

**Status (pass-2):** superseded on two counts. (1) Phase 17
(c5a8fbc) already shipped per-route `opengraph-image.tsx` +
OG PNG rendering via `scripts/build-icons.mjs`. (2) The May
2026 design pivot deleted the per-show facade system entirely
(phase 19a, `design/CLAUDE.md` Hard Rule 1) — S5's premise
("deriving from the show's facade") references art that no
longer exists and must never be regenerated. Kept for the
audit trail; `/expand` will not re-propose it.

### S6. Vercel Analytics dashboard review cadence

**Trigger:** ~30 days after launch (whenever real user traffic
starts).
**Scope sketch:** weekly `/oversight` checkpoint reads Vercel
Analytics dashboard; surfaces top-N pages, drop-off points,
404s; files audit rows for any URL with >5% bounce. Lightweight
human-in-loop ritual.

_(S7 promoted retroactively — see ## Promoted above. Phase 29 (c4ed547) shipped the scope.)_
